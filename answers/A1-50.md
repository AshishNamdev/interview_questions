- In Python list, we can count the occurences of a individual element by using a `count()` function.

### Example # 1:
```python
week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print(week_days.count('mon'))
```
### Output:
```bash
3
```
### Example # 2:
```python
week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print([[x,week_days.count(x)] for x in set(week_days)])
```
### Output:
```bash
[['wed', 1], ['sun', 2], ['thu', 1], ['tue', 1], ['mon', 3], ['fri', 1]]
```

- By using Python `tuple()` function we can convert a list into a tuple. But we can't change the list after turning it into tuple, because it becomers immutable.

### Example:
```python
week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
list_as_tuple = tuple(week_days)
print(list_as_tuple)
```
### Output:
```bash
('sun', 'mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat')
```

# A11
- User can convert list into set by using `set()` function.

### Example:
```python
week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat','sun','tue']
list_as_set = set(week_days)
print(list_as_set)
```
### Output:
```bash
set(['wed', 'sun', 'thu', 'tue', 'mon', 'fri', 'sat'])
```

# A12
- When we want to convert a list into a string, we can use the `.join()` method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

### Example:
```python
week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
list_as_str = ' '.join(week_days)
print(list_as_str)
```

- The `yield` keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.
But it'll always return a generator object. Also, a function can have multiple calls to the `yield` keyword.

### Example:
```python
def test_gen(index):
    week_days = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
    yield week_days[index]
    yield week_days[index+1]

day = testgen(0)
print(next(day), next(day))
```
### Output:
```bash
sun mon
```
